class Job:
    """Represents a job on the Xanadu Cloud.

    Args:
        id_ (str): ID of the job
        connection (Connection): connection to the Xanadu Cloud

    .. note::

        For performance reasons, the properties of a job are lazily fetched and
        stored in a cache. This cache can be cleared at any time by calling
        :meth:`Job.clear`.

    .. warning::

        The :class:`xcc.Job` class transparently contacts the Xanadu Cloud when
        an uncached job property is accessed. This means that requesting a job
        property for the first time may take longer than expected.

    **Example:**

    The following example shows how to use the :class:`Job` class to submit and
    track a job for a simulator on the Xanadu Cloud. First, a connection is
    established to the Xanadu Cloud:

    >>> import xcc
    >>> connection = xcc.Connection(key="Xanadu Cloud API key goes here")

    Next, the parameters of the desired job are prepared. At present, this
    includes the name, target, circuit, and language of the job:

    >>> import inspect
    >>> name = "example"
    >>> target = "simulon_gaussian"
    >>> circuit = inspect.cleandoc(
            f\"\"\"
            name {name}
            version 1.0
            target {target} (shots=3)

            MeasureFock() | [0, 1, 2, 3];
            \"\"\"
        )
    >>> language = "blackbird:1.0"

    The job is then submitted to the Xanadu Cloud using the :func:`Job.submit`
    function:

    >>> job = xcc.Job.submit(
            connection,
            name=name,
            target=target,
            circuit=circuit,
            language=language,
        )

    At this point, the Xanadu Cloud has received the job; however, it may take
    some time before the result of the job is available. To wait until the job
    is finished, a blocking call is made to :meth:`Job.wait`:

    >>> job.wait()

    Finally, the status, result, running time, etc. of the job are retrieved by
    accessing the corresponding properties of the job:

    >>> job.status
    'complete'
    >>> job.result
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint64)
    >>> job.running_time
    0.123456
