### Before submitting

Please complete the following checklist when submitting a PR:

- [ ] All new features must include a unit test. If you've fixed a bug or added
      code that should be tested, add a test to the [`tests/`](tests/) directory!

- [ ] All new classes, functions, and members must be clearly commented and
      documented.

- [ ] Ensure that the test suite passes by running `make test`.

- [ ] Ensure that code is properly formatted by running `make format lint`.

- [ ] Add a new entry to [`CHANGELOG.md`](.github/CHANGELOG.md), summarizing the
      change and including a link back to the PR.

When all the above are checked, delete everything above the dashed
line and fill in the pull request template.
