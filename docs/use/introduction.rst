The Xanadu Cloud Client (XCC) is a Python API and CLI for the Xanadu Cloud which
aims to support the following workflows:

* Configure your local Xanadu Cloud credentials.

* Fetch information about devices on the Xanadu Cloud.

* Submit jobs to the Xanadu Cloud and retrieve their results.

Follow the `development guide <../dev/guide.html>`_ to get the XCC up and
running and then have a look at the `README
<https://github.com/XanaduAI/xanadu-cloud-client/blob/main/README.md>`_ to see
what you can do with the XCC.
