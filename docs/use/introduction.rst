The Xanadu Cloud Client (XCC) is a Python API and CLI for the Xanadu Cloud which
aims to support the following workflows:

* Configure your local Xanadu Cloud credentials.

* Fetch information about devices on the Xanadu Cloud.

* Submit jobs to the Xanadu Cloud and retrieve their results.

Follow the `development guide <../dev/guide.html>`_ to get the XCC ready for
local development or have a look at the `walkthrough <walkthrough.rst>`_ to see
what you can do with the XCC.
